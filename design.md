standard for commit message format.

## Internal library logging

It's achieved using the `log` functions defined in *./lib/logging/log.js*
and level specific shortcuts in the same directory.

To enable SDK internal logs, the debug level needs to be provided in the
SDK options in the `require` call, i.e.:

```
const debug = require("./logging/debug")({ debug: "DEBUG" })
```

## Directory structure

The functionality related do different endpoints of the API is organized in
directories mimicing the names of The One API endpoints, for example: all 
the code related to the */book* endpoint can be found in *./lib/book* 
directory.

The *./lib/logging* directory contains the logic used for internal SDK
logging.

## Testing

### Mocks

The library is tested against mock responses stored in *./test/mocks*. Those
are slightly modified versions of actual responses from The One API.
